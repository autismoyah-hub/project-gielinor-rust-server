# OpenRune correction backlog

## Gameplay findings

No confirmed gameplay defect from the completed initial scoped tests. This is not acceptance of untested behavior. No critical or dependency-blocking finding currently requires FORGE to stop or change its implementation sequence.

## PG-INFRA-001 — empty super-combat test selection

- Class: test-infrastructure blocker; verification harness only.
- Feature: OR-MIG-0010.
- Exact implementation SHA: `5a260c1bd6efa5f8a221bed7c96e6ac72fd428bc`.
- Reproduction: `cargo test --offline --locked -j 1 -p gielinor-world --lib super_combat`.
- Expected: execute four-input mixing and its authoritative action tests.
- Actual: Cargo compiled successfully but selected zero tests. This supplies build evidence and no gameplay acceptance.
- Cause: initial PROVING GROUND filter used a feature name instead of the module name.
- Correction: use `combat_mixing` for both world and server filters; count selected tests and reject zero-test runs.
- Evidence: `independent/OR-MIG-0010-5a260c1bd6ef/` and its subsequent attempt directory.
- Implementation blocking: no. No FORGE production correction or GitHub issue is appropriate for this verifier-owned defect.
- Status: resolved. The corrected filter reran at the same exact SHA: four world tests and one server test passed. The initial empty-selection logs and ledger row remain preserved. The original runner's raw manifest reported `PARTIAL` from exit codes alone; the ledger explicitly classifies that attempt as `BLOCKED`, and the corrected runner rejects zero-test selections.

## Open coverage work

All contracts require V0–V4. Native super-combat and chemistry controls, acknowledged-save/restart/relogin recovery, and source/reference subcomparisons now have independent evidence. Complete negative/modifier matrices, interrupted production, applicable crash recovery and remaining content still need acceptance. See DASHBOARD.md for current levels. Coverage gaps are not alleged implementation defects. Where a concrete fixture, dependency or specification prevents execution, append a precise blocked attempt and a contract request rather than substituting another SHA.

## PG-INFRA-002 — food verifier trace and dirty-slot assumptions

- Class: resolved verification-infrastructure defect; no confirmed gameplay defect.
- Feature/revision: OR-MIG-0024 revision2, `a560034a59e766d1faf400b61187fec861d13475`.
- Initial attempt: `independent/OR-MIG-0024-a560034a59e7-independent/` preserves the failed test source, hash, binary identity and logs.
- Actual: ordinary food does not always emit the optional multipart `FoodTransition`; a normal authoritative tick can update inventory synchronization metadata while item slots remain identical.
- Expected correction: assert exactly one real food animation for successful queued consumption and compare actual inventory slots for stale-input item conservation. Keep HP, all XP, delay and replay assertions.
- Retest: corrected independent external crate passed four test functions covering319 fixtures through actual `World::submit` and `World::tick` at the same SHA. The failed attempt remains historical verifier evidence, not an implementation failure.
- FORGE impact: none; no production fix or GitHub issue requested.

## Measured execution deferrals

Chemistry build attempts were deferred during observed compiler contention, including53% CPU. Later one-job builds proceeded with spare CPU and over6GiB available RAM; no other agent was paused or altered. Resource measurements are preserved with the deep campaign. A deferral is not a failed server build or a gameplay defect.

The handoff's `ba455a6` identifier is an informational mismatch: the fetched original contract commit is `ba455a0278f3f0b5ac6cbe377b6a8b83f0e95348`. This did not block inspection or testing, and it is not a gameplay defect.

## PG-INFRA-003 — dynamic-food verifier argument types and synthetic labels

- Class: resolved verifier-only defect, no confirmed production defect.
- Target: OR-MIG-0035 at `1446167370dece10751c4c332929af880259ee23`.
- The first external harness used unsigned variables for signed stat setter arguments. Cargo rejected the test crate; the unchanged production world library compiled. Checked conversions now cover the bounded 1–99 base and 0–104 current values.
- Independent pinned-reference inspection also corrected swapped watermelon/sweetcorn labels in synthetic fixtures (5984 and 5988 respectively). This affects test identity; these fixtures never claimed configured runtime binding acceptance. Earlier source snapshots and logs remain preserved.
- The intermediate corrected policy suite passed three test functions; the final label-corrected suite is a separate attempt. A measured 35.55% CPU deferral between attempts is recorded as execution contention, not a build or gameplay failure. Current completed outcomes are in WORKLIST.json and the attempt manifests.
- No FORGE source edit, stop request or gameplay issue is appropriate.

## Finding format

For each confirmed defect, record a stable finding ID, feature ID, full tested SHA, severity, expected/actual states, precise reproduction and scenario, evidence paths, affected dependency chain, implementation-blocking status, GitHub issue, and correction/retest history. Preserve historical failures after a fix. Search existing issues before filing a duplicate.
